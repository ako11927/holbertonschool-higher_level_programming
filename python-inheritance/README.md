# Python Inheritance Project

This project contains Python scripts that demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, specifically inheritance and class inspection in Python.

## Files

### 0-lookup.py
Contains a function `lookup(obj)` that returns a list of available attributes and methods of any given object.

### 1-my_list.py
Contains a class `MyList` that inherits from Python's built-in `list` class and adds a `print_sorted()` method to print the list in sorted order without modifying the original list.

### 2-is_same_class.py
Contains a function `is_same_class(obj, a_class)` that returns `True` if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class, otherwise `False`.

### 3-is_kind_of_class.py
Contains a function `is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class)` that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or inherited from, the specified class.

### 4-inherits_from.py
Contains a function `inherits_from(obj, a_class)` that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class.

### 5-base_geometry.py
Contains an empty `BaseGeometry` class that serves as a base class for geometric shapes.

### 6-base_geometry.py
Contains an updated `BaseGeometry` class with an `area()` method that raises an exception when called (to be implemented by subclasses).

## Usage

Each script can be run independently or imported as a module. Test files are provided for the `MyList` class.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files are executable and follow PEP 8 style guide
